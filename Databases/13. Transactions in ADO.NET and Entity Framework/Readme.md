## Transactions in ADO.NET and Entity Framework

1. Suppose you are creating a simple engine for an ATM machine. Create a new database "ATM" in SQL Server to hold the accounts of the card holders and the balance (money) for each account. Add a new table `CardAccounts` with the following fields: 
    `Id (int)
    CardNumber (char(10))
    CardPIN (char(4))
    CardCash (money)`
 * Add a few sample records in the table.
